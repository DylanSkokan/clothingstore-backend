# ICS499-Final-Project
Final Project for Spring Semester 2023

We are building an eccommerce full stack application utlizing Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and angular. The application will allow a user to buy, return, and view your
everyday clothing items such as shirts, shoes, socks, and much more. 

We are utilizing these languages in order to build new skills and explore different techniques and approaches to help develope our skills as future developers. 

Some of our current challanges include: version types utilizing Spring Boot and integreating our JPA annotations into to create a database in PostgreSQL.
